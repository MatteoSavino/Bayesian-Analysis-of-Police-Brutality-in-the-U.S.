## Introduction
With this project we want to study the phenomenon of the police brutality in the U.S. and in particular if there is a racial bias in the actions of the police. 
In particular we have focused our work on the study of the risks associated with being an Afro-American people or an Hispanic one distinguish also the case of an armed people and an unarmed one.

This is a plot of the killings all over the U.S across the six years (2015-2020) that we have taken in count for our analysis

## Results
We can say that is actually present a racial bias against the Afro-Americans people in all the U.S. while for the Hispanic ones is not a so widespread phenomenon, but it is more restricted to some specific states. 

Here there are some plots of the results we have obtained, where 'R' is the so called 'Risk Rate' of being shot given a certain ethnicity and condition during the arrest (armed or unarmed):
